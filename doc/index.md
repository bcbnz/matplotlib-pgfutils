The [Portable Graphics Format (PGF)][1] is a language for producing vector
graphics within TeX documents. There is also a higher-level language TikZ (TikZ
ist kein Zeichenprogramm -- TikZ is not a drawing program) which uses PGF.

Since version 1.2, the Python plotting library [Matplotlib][2] has included a
PGF backend to generate figures ready for inclusion in a TeX document. In order
to get consistent figures that fit with the style of the document, this
requires some configuration. The aim of pgfutils is to simplify this
configuration and allow figures to be easily generated from a Python script.

The module provides two functions which set up and then save the figure. The
actual plotting is performed by standard Matplotlib functions. For example, to
generate a plot showing the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th and 11th harmonics of an
ideal square wave and the resulting sum:

```python
# Set up the figure environment.
from pgfutils import setup_figure, save
setup_figure(width=0.9, height=0.4)

import numpy as np
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

# Generate square wave from a few terms of its Fourier series.
f = 3
t = np.linspace(0, 1, 501)
square = np.zeros(t.shape)
for n in range(1, 12, 2):
    # Create this harmonic and plot it as a dashed
    # partially-transparent line.
    component = np.sin(2 * n * np.pi * f * t) / n
    plt.plot(t, component, '--', alpha=0.4)

    # Add it to the overall signal.
    square += component

# Scale the final sum.
square *= 4 / np.pi

# Plot and label the figure.
plt.plot(t, square, 'C0')
plt.xlim(0, 1)
plt.ylim(-1.2, 1.2)
plt.xlabel("Time (s)")
plt.ylabel("Amplitude (V)")

# Save as a PGF image.
save()
```

Requirements
------------

Using pgfutils requires Python 3. Each commit is currently tested with release
versions of Python 3.6 and 3.7, as well as a development version of Python 3.8.

The only external dependency is matplotlib. All the other dependencies are part
of the standard Python library.


Examples
--------

pgfutils comes with some examples which demonstrate its usage and integration
into a build system. Depending on your installation method, these may be
present somewhere in your filesystem (e.g., on a Linux system, they might be at
`/usr/share/matplotlib-pgfutils/examples`). They can also be found in the
`data/share/matplotlib-pgfutils/examples` directory of the source or online [in the
GitHub repository][3].
